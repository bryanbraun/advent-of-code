# Go Practice

A repo of programs written in [Go](https://golang.org/) for practice.

The challenges come from [the 2019 advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/).

## Running the programs

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Choose a day: `cd day1`
3. Compile a binary: `go build main.go`
4. Execute the binary: `./main`
